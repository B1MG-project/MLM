           <p>The B1MG Maturity level model (MLM) aims to promote and facilitate the adoption of genomics by healthcare systems for making personalised medicine accessible to citizens and patients across Europe.<br>
            Experts from the B1MG project developed the MLM framework to enable all interested countries to self evaluate the level of maturity of national genomic medicine practices following a common matrix.</li></ol>
